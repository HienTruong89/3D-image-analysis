# @Topic 1: 3D image analysis 
         In this section, 3D fluorescence images were observed. 
   
         The aim is to segment important features in the image with common image processing techniques. 
   
         Then, fit the image data to deep learning neural networks. 
   
# @ Topic 2: 2D RGB/Gray image analysis
         Similar to topic 1, using different processing techniques to analyse 2D image. 

         Perform convolutional neural networks to classify the image.
